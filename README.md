Hi and welcome to this mess of a Dodgeball pack

This was made on version 1.21.6 so don't run it on other versions without expecting issues. It will not be updated to support future or previous versions of the game.

This only works with 2 teams; Red and Blue. 
If you want different colours, tough :shrug:

Anywho....

To get started;
Make an arena (the only thing I can't do for you)

Do /function dodgeball:give and you'll get 9 armour stands for the waypoints. You need to place these where they need to go. This pack is good but it's not witchcraft

Blue Team Hub - This is where your players stand if they want to go onto the Blue Team
Red Team Hub - This is where your players stand if they want to go onto the Red Team
Spectator Hub - This is where your players stand if they are wanting to spectate the match
Blue Team Spawn - Where the Blue Team gets teleported to when the game starts
Red Team Spawn - Where the Red Team gets teleported to when the game starts
Spectator Spawn - Where the Spectators gets teleported to when the game starts
Blue Team Dodgeball Spawn - Spawns dodgeballs for the Blue Team
Red Team Dodgeball Spawn - Spawns dodgeballs for the Red Team
Debug Mode - Exactly what it says. Only use this if you are going to read all the files. To leave debug mode do /kill @e[tag=Dodgeball_Debug_Mode]

To start the game run /function dodgeball:start
How you do that is up to you. Command block it, schedule it, somehow activate it via a tin can on a piece of string, everyone's different.

Enjoy the pack!
Only contact OGCraft if the pack isn't working as intended AND you're on 1.21.6 https://ogcraft.org/discord
